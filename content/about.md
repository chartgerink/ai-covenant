"Artificial Intelligence" (AI) tools are spreading in usage, and with that new behaviors show up that affect communities. People in our communities may feel unsafe or not welcome as a result of how AI tools are used. The use of AI tools without consent of the people involved may even result in harm. For example, group trust can be breached by adding an AI assistant to a meeting or using generated content without clearly labeling it as such.

The AI Covenant sets out shared norms for responsible use of AI. We want to make sure our community spaces are safe and welcoming also when AI tools are used. The AI Covenant is inspired by [the Contributor Covenant]() and aims to be copy-pasted into your own code of conduct. The AI Covenant is available under a CC0 Public Domain Dedication --- this means you can adjust it as you see fit. After all, the AI Covenant is a departure point and discussion starter.

The idea for this "AI Code of Conduct" originated during the Collaborations Workshop 2024, in conversations between Eli Chadwick and Matt Craddock.. Riva Quiroga and Chris Hartgerink expanded on the idea and built the website that you are looking at now.

Codes of conduct help make explicit what behaviors are welcome and unwelcome in a community. With so-called "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) tools spreading in usage, new behaviors show up that we may feel uncomfortable with. [Maybe we can say that this is about taking into account these new behaviors in the conversation about what makes our spaces safe and welcoming for everyone participating in them]

We want to make it easier for people to use AI responsibly in their communities. Since the launch of generative AI models like ChatGPT and integrations like GitHub Copilot, these discussions are being had in communities. As this development is still ongoing, we provide the AI Covenant as an addition to the Contributor Covenant.

Responsible use of AI is not one-size fits all - the covenant is a starting point for your communities. 

We created the initial version of the AI Covenant during the hackday at the Collaborations Workshop 2024. The original idea for an "AI Code of Conduct" came from Eli Chadwick, Matt Craddock. Riva Quiroga and Chris Hartgerink expanded on the idea and built the website that you are looking at now.

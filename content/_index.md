The use of "Artificial Intelligence" models affects the dynamics between people. We encourage mindful and considerate use of "AI" in our community that is grounded in our community values.

Specific behaviors we do not allow:

- Passing generated content off as your own
- Arriving to a meeting with an AI assistant without asking the other participants
- Sending your AI assistant to meetings in your place
- - If the use of generative tools has been allowed, not verifying or validating the generated content.
- [fully AI based production cycles]

Specific behaviors we encourage/allow:

- Marking any generated content with the model and prompt used for its creation (for example images).
- Requesting consent of participants and organizers to use AI based tools.
  - ...use "AI"
- Inform other participants if data or content they have produced is going to be shared with an "AI" tool (e.g., for content summarization)
- Justify the use of "AI" on a case by case basis, taking into account risks, harms.

[As a general principle, we recommend regarding AI as a third-party you are involving, who you are responsible for. Inviting a third-party to a meeting or sharing information with them can be a breach of community trust.]

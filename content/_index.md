The use of "Artificial Intelligence" models affects the dynamics between people. We encourage mindful and considerate use of "AI" in our community that is grounded in our community values.

Specific behaviors we do not allow:

- Passing generated content off as your own
- Sending your AI assistant to meetings in your place
- [promoting the use of AI for everything (AI-ifying everything)]
- [not verifying or validating generated content]
- [fully AI based production cycles]

Specific behaviors we encourage/allow:

- Generated content is specifically marked with the model + prompt (for example images)
- Requesting consent to...
  - ...use "AI"
  - ...share [information] with "AI"
- Justify the use of "AI" on a case by case basis, taking into account risks, harms.

[As a general principle, we recommend regarding AI as a third-party you are involving, who you are responsible for. Inviting a third-party to a meeting or sharing information with them can be a breach of community trust.]

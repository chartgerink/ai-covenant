The use of "Artificial Intelligence" models affects the dynamics between people. We encourage mindful and considerate use of "AI" in our community that is grounded in our community values.

Specific behaviors we do not allow:

- Using AI tools without the consent of the people affected.
- If the use of generative tools has been allowed, not verifying or validating the generated content.
- Passing AI generated content off as your own.
- Arriving to a meeting with an AI assistant without asking the other participants.
- Sending your AI assistant to meetings in your place.

Specific behaviors we encourage/allow:

- Request consent of participants and organizers to use AI based tools.
- Justify the use of AI on a case by case basis, taking into account risks, harms.
- Inform other participants if data or content they produced is going to be shared with an AI tool (e.g., for content summarization).
- If an AI tool is used (with consent) to generate information about someone (e.g., transcription), provide affected people with ways to correct the information.
- Mark any generated content with the model and prompt used for its creation (for example images).

As a general principle, AI is a third-party that is involved, and the person involving the third-party is responsible for them. Inviting a third-party to a meeting or sharing information with them can be a breach of community trust, when it happens without consent.

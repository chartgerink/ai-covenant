# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Covenant

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/11d21edf-06f0-44f1-b167-47da498a869b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ai-covenant/deploys)

This is a micro-repository to write and host the AI Covenant. The name is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). All pull requests are auto-deployed using Netlify.

The AI Covenant is a starting point for collectives that want to mindfully use AI in their work. Some behaviors can be harmful if not done with consent, and we want people to be respectful when using AI.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress. :blush:

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! We started this AI Covenant only as a departure point to stimulate further discussions. Your pull requests and issues are much appreciated to further that discussion - please participate with considerateness towards one another :blush:
